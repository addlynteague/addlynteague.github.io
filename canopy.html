							<p><a href="http://www.canopysoftware.com/" target="_blank">Canopy Software</a> is a Tallahassee company that turns short-term programming projects into full-fledged profitable business endeavors. Their “branches” create innovative technology solutions to help make businesses and associations more efficient with their operations. Some branches I had the pleasure of working on were SWIMM, which is a series of motivational videos for people dealing with anxiety, <a href="https://www.prolydian.com/" target="_blank">Prolydian,</a> which is testing software, <a href="http://www.mediationcasemanager.com/" target="_blank">Mediation Case Manager,</a> which is a platform mediation programs can efficiently work with, and <a href="https://www.rallywise.com/" target="_blank">RallyWise,</a> which is an app that helps associations stay updated on legislative issues.</p>
							<p>As the Business Development Intern, my goal was to reach out to potential clients for each branch and promote Canopy’s products and services. I also created content that showcased information about the products and services through social media and sales flyers. Below are some examples of social media posts I created for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Prolydian/" target="_blank">Prolydian</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rallywise/" target="_blank">RallyWise</a> branches in the fall of 2018. They advertise features and benefits of each product as well as share clever quotes that relate to the topic.</p>

							<p>This final document consists of four written pieces: a sales flyer for RallyWise, a sales flyer for Prolydian Achieve, a Prolydian article on the responses of a testing center survey, and an explanation of Mediation Case Manager and how it works. The sales flyers share what the product is about, helpful features and benefits, and place the potential client in a scenario that specifies why they should purchase the product. The Prolydian article shares detailed responses from testing centers about how they have experienced cheating and problems they want to solve. The article ends with explaining why Prolydian’s SEAL product would benefit their company, based on the popular responses. The final written piece simply shares what Mediation Case Manager is and how it works. Please note that I do not take responsibility for writing the Our History section. My former boss copied and pasted it from a previous document.</p>

							<p>This is a fraction of the work I completed at Canopy. One of my main tasks was finding potential clients of RallyWise and Prolydian and reaching out to them via email. These clients were testing centers, colleges and universities, and state associations. I found their emails either from the surveys my boss sent out or by retrieving them from a website. For the SWIMM branch, I watched all 30-35 of the videos and created captions so members could understand a little bit about each video before they watched it. One of my final tasks was to retrieve all of the names of Florida’s state representatives and senators, place them in their 56 committees/ subcommittees, and upload their names and pictures into the RallyWise database. </p>
							
							<p>Canopy was an amazing company to intern at for thirteen months. Everyone that works there was so kind and helpful. I enjoyed our volunteer day picking up trash in the Wacissa River as well as our Friday foosball tournaments. I appreciate Jennings, Jay, and Jamie for this opportunity.</p>
